## README

This is my first project. I am creating a website for a Local Abilene Landscaper and I hope my project turns out great. 

I don’t have as much experience working with Rails as I do working with the best Lawn Service around. I know a lot of landscapers in the 

Abilene area. These guys have always done a good job.

## The Power in a Website

Back to the technical side, I’ve decided that they need help on their website. I’ve talked to the owner about doing a simple site in Weebly 

but he wants something better. He really is looking to expand his business in the near future. We will see what I can do for him. He wants 

to rank for landscapers in Tuscola and landscapers in Abilene. They are the best at Landscape Design.
